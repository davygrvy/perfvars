# perfvars
MusicBrainz Picard plugin

This plugin provides the 'recorded at' attributes for live releases
and recordings as variables for use in filenaming and tagger
scripts.  If the location is an event, 'held at' is used instead.
Two additional functions are provided that filter
Live-Bootleg-Style from release and recording comments.

This plugin caches data requests, so it will be kind to our server ;)
